    summary: ToCount: Lightweight Token Estimator
    description: |
	    ToCount is a lightweight and extensible Python library for estimating token counts from text inputs using both rule-based and machine learning methods.
        Designed for flexibility, speed, and accuracy, ToCount provides a unified interface for different estimation strategies, making it ideal for tasks like prompt analysis,
        token budgeting, and optimizing interactions with token-based systems.
